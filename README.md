My application is about currency converter , USD to INR and INR to USD. After running my application it asks to enter name, then it asks to enter any button to continue or q to quit. After entering any button other than q, it asks to enter 1 for USD to INR conversion and enter 2 for INR to USD conversion. Depending on the number you entered it asks for the amount to be converted and displays the converted currency and exits.
